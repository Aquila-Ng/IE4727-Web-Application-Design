        <p>
            According to Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web,

        </p>
        <blockquote>
            The power of the Web is in its universality.
            <em>Access by everyone</em> 
            <strong>regardless of</strong> disability is
            an essential aspect.
